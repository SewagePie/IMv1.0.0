# IMv1.0.0
My first small codebase in Python! It's a simple--fake desktop intruder detector program.

--------What this is---------                                                                                             
This is just a small project for myself in order to learn Python and create a portfolio. 
Don't expect anything complicated, this is just a fun little codebase I made in a single night so I could prank intuders trying to mess with my laptop. This does keylog your keystrokes and mouse clicks/movement. It isn't stored anywhere and it's only used to log when someone interacts with the fake desktop. This is all printed into your terminal.

---------INPUTS--------                                                                                                                     
There is no UI, you have to insert file paths and urls directly into the code, so if you don't have VSC, Python, Pygame, or any coding experience (Which I'm assuming you do) then this will not work.
I have made comments on every input so you don't have to search for them. Just copy paste the file path and file name between the quotation marks.

---------Bugs--------                                                                                                                     
From what I know, there are no bugs. Although, I don't know much about Python, So take that with a grain of salt. If you do notice bugs, then know that I won't fix them. Either fix them yourself or delete the code from your computer, since I will not be touching this code ever again. Like I said two paragraphs above, this was just a small project I did while learning Python.
